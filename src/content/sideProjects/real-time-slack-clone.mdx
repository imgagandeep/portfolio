## Project Overview

This side project is a **real-time Slack clone**, built with modern web technologies: **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Auth.js**, and **Socket.io**. It demonstrates how to create a fully responsive, feature-rich collaboration platform, combining powerful real-time communication features with modern UI design.

The app enables users to:

- Create and manage **workspaces**
- **Invite members** to collaborate
- Start **channels** and threaded conversations
- **Share images**, react with emojis, and edit messages
- Chat **one-on-one** in direct messages
- Enjoy a sleek, fully responsive UI that adapts seamlessly across devices

By leveraging WebSockets via Socket.io, the project ensures smooth, real-time updates across users without the need to refresh. Authentication and workspace management are handled with Auth.js, showcasing practical integration of modern authentication patterns. This project not only serves as a functional team chat app but also as an educational tool for learning how to combine front-end and back-end in a modern full stack application.

## Future Plans

Looking ahead, I plan to extend this project with additional features and optimizations:

1. **Voice and video calls** using WebRTC
2. **Rich media previews** for shared links and files
3. **Advanced permissions** and roles within workspaces
4. **AI-assisted features** like summarizing threads or suggesting replies

Additionally, I intend to refine and modularize the codebase to make it more maintainable and open for contributions, including:

1. Extracting UI components into a **design system** with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI
2. Adding **unit and integration tests** for critical flows
3. Improving **accessibility** and keyboard navigation
4. Deploying scalable back-end infrastructure with serverless functions and a managed database

This evolution will transform the project into a production-grade, open-source Slack alternative, serving as both a showcase of modern full stack development and a valuable reference for developers building collaborative real-time apps.
