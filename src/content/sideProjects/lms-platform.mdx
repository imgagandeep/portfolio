## Project Overview

This side project is an **LMS (Learning Management System) platform** designed to support both students and teachers, built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It offers a complete e-learning experience by combining dynamic course management, real-time analytics, and seamless purchasing workflows.

Key features include:

- **Student Mode:**
  - Browse, search, and filter courses
  - Purchase courses securely (powered by **Stripe**)
  - Track learning progress across enrolled courses
- **Teacher Mode:**
  - Create, edit, and manage course content
  - View real-time analytics on student engagement and purchases
  - Monitor individual student progress and course completion rates

The platform focuses on usability and responsiveness, delivering an intuitive experience across desktop and mobile devices. The inclusion of real-time analytics and purchase data helps educators tailor content and track performance, making it a practical tool for real-world learning businesses or as a full stack developer showcase.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to expand this LMS platform with more advanced and interactive features, including:

1. **Video lectures and quizzes** integrated directly into courses
2. **Certificates of completion** generated dynamically
3. **Gamification features** like badges and leaderboards
4. **AI-powered recommendations** for students based on their interests and progress

Additionally, I aim to further refine the developer experience and scalability of the project by:

1. Modularizing the codebase into reusable components and hooks
2. Adding **serverless functions** for background tasks like analytics aggregation
3. Integrating **GraphQL** for more flexible data queries
4. Improving accessibility and multilingual support

This evolution will transform the platform into a production-ready, full-featured online learning ecosystem, showcasing how to build scalable, user-centric edtech products using modern web technologies.
